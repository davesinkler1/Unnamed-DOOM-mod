# Unnamed-DOOM-mod

This was supposed to be a DOOM mod where you play as a gun-for-hire in anarcho-capitalist jakarta in which you are tasked to infiltrate and eliminate a resistance movement opposing one of the capitalist leader of jakarta.

It is unfinished

So far there is only one playable level but no enemies in it

Can be played via GZDoom by putting the .wad file into the mod manager
