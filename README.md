# Unnamed-DOOM-mod
This was supposed to be a DOOM mod where you play as a gun-for-hire in anarcho-capitalist jakarta in which you are tasked to infiltrate and eliminate a resistance movement opposing one of the capitalist leader of jakarta.

It is unfinished

Only one level is available to play but there are no enemies and only a few selection of weapons

Can be played using GZDoom by adding the .wad file into the mod manager
